# Vegetarian Zen Podcast

## Overview

So what exactly is the Vegetarian Zen podcast? It was formed in June of 2013, shortly after the two founders, Vicki and Larissa, watched two films about vegetarianism and decided to convert to vegetarianism. They knew that there were many questions about being a vegetarian, so this podcast is aimed to educate others about what it's like to be a vegetarian. It consists of topics related to eating healthy, exercising, animal cruelty, the environment, and others. So far, there are 208 episodes and one new episode is added to the podcast weekly. For each episode added, there is also a quote of the week, recipe of the week, and additional resources to complement the podcast.
