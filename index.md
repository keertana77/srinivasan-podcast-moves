## Overview:
> ### *"Happy Body, Healthy Mind"* - Vegetarian Zen

So what exactly is the Vegetarian Zen podcast? It was formed in June of 2013, shortly after the two founders, Vicki and Larissa, watched two films about vegetarianism and decided to convert to vegetarianism. They knew that there were many questions about being a vegetarian, so this podcast is aimed to educate others about what it's like to be a vegetarian. It consists of topics related to eating healthy, exercising, animal cruelty, the environment, and others. So far, there are 208 episodes and one new episode is added to the podcast weekly. For each episode added, there is also a quote of the week, recipe of the week, and additional resources to complement the podcast.

## Organization:

The beginning of each podcast sometimes started with a male recorded voice and sometimes it didn't - it was about half and half. Then, the speakers starts to talk and start with the podcast name, episode number, episode name, and a catchy hook. Then, the speakers introduce themselves and they provide an informative introduction about the theme of the episode. In some episodes, the speaker provides a reason for making podcast (eg: did someone request it, was that topic trending, etc). Then, two speakers - Vicki and Larissa - switch off and talk about their experiences with vegetarianism. They talk about an equal amount, adding to each other's thoughts - it felt like a conversation and there wasn't one person talking more than the other. The speakers blended in informative bits as well to balance the podcast well between knowledge and experience. Some podcasts focused more on one or the other (information vs. experience), but for the most part, they were well-balanced. In addition, the speakers also talked about concerns that others had and helped to clear those concerns. The podcasts focused a lot on user feedback as well, and worked to answer people's questions and clear their doubts. The podcasts were structured in a way that made it easy to pay attention to - they were concise, informative, and covered the entire scope of the topic. The speakers both contributed unique knowledge and information to the podcast.

## Style:

Sound effects were minimal, but they were enjoyable and weren't distracting. Each podcast started with some cheerful opening music - a bell ringing and happy piano tunes. The podcasts ended with some happy music as well. There was a male recorded voice at the beginning and end at times, but this did not always occur.

## Narrative Types:

Some of these podcasts were interview-based, while others weren't. Three of the episodes were the two main speakers interviewing a guest speaker. Examples include:
* [Episode 045: "Interview with Farnoosh Brock," Farnoosh Brock, the author of "The Healthy Smoothie Bible" and a few other related books, is featured. Vickie and Larissa ask Brock questions and Brock answers them extensively, such as about fresh juice bars, smoothie bars, healthy portions, good eating habits, and more.](http://www.vegetarianzen.com/blog/2014/04/27/vz-045/)

* [Episode 113: Interview with Megan Cain, AKA The Creative Vegetable Gardener](http://www.vegetarianzen.com/blog/2015/08/16/vz-113/)

* [Episode 28: Tim Paige Interview](http://www.vegetarianzen.com/blog/2013/12/22/vz-028-tim-paige-interview/)
These episodes are interview-based but seem conversational and unscripted.

Some episodes were more lesson and experienced based, and the speakers spoke primarily of lessons they learned through an experiment or would advise the audience a suggested way to do something. The following episodes are examples of that:
* [Episode 31: Lessons Learned in a Year of Being Vegetarian](http://www.vegetarianzen.com/blog/2014/01/19/vz-031-vegetarian-lessons-learned/): This podcast discusses the importance of support when becoming a vegetarian, give yourself credit for your progress, don't scold yourself for cravings, and more. It focuses mainly on the experiences the two speakers had over their first year of being a vegetarian and what main lessons they learned from that experience.

* [Episode 99: Simple Gardening Tips - Lessons Learned in Our Garden](http://www.vegetarianzen.com/blog/2015/05/10/vz-099/)

* [Episode 29: New Year's Resolutions](http://www.vegetarianzen.com/blog/2013/12/29/vz-029-new-years-resolutions/)

* [Episode 114: How to Take Frozen Vegetables from Frosty to Fabulous](http://www.vegetarianzen.com/blog/2015/08/23/vz114/)

The rest of the episodes, which are not based off interviews, are more conversational narratives that answer questions, share experiences, as well as share tips and how-to's - they are a balanced combination of all of these things. One speaker would talk and share, and the other speaker would add her thoughts to that. The podcasts were very informal and didn't seem overly scripted. It seemed that the topic and a basic outline had been planned in advance, but the actual flow seemed informal and very natural. The speakers would laugh and crack jokes. They would add side notes, too, and add to each other's sentences and thoughts, which is why it didn't seem scripted. Examples of these episodes include:
* [Episode 002: A Life of Spice](http://www.vegetarianzen.com/blog/2013/08/04/vz-008-all-about-tofu/): This episode focused on four beneficial spices. The speakers discuss juices and putting spices in juices to make it better. They also name several books that have recipes for juices and the basics of juicing. The speakers discussed ginger tea, ginger bread, candied ginger, and they talked about the benefits of ginger for the immune system, and also how good it tastes. This is one great example of how they were able to blend knowledge and their own experience - they gave their experiences with ginger and its different uses and what they had tried cooking, then went on to explain why ginger is so good for you.

* [Episode 012: Tips to Avoid Being a Junk Food Vegetarian](http://www.vegetarianzen.com/blog/2013/09/01/vz-012-junk-food-vegetarian/)
![](http://www.vegetarianzen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/I-get-my-VEG-on-final-design.png)

* [Episode 008: All About Tofu](http://www.vegetarianzen.com/blog/2013/08/04/vz-008-all-about-tofu/)

## My Thoughts

I really loved this podcast. I have been a vegetarian my whole life and I wanted to learn more about it and why other people convert to vegetarianism. I feel like there's always so much to learn, even if you think you know a subject well, and I really found that to be true through this! In this podcast, I could really feel the amiability of the two speakers through my screen, and I really appreciate that. Since the speakers were also married, the podcast felt a lot more personal and very comfortable to listen to, because I didn't feel any awkwardness or over-formality. It just felt like two educated people talking and sharing with their audience. I also loved that the speakers based their podcasts a lot off of user feedback. They would carefully look at the questions their followers asked them, and make podcasts dedicated to answering these questions and clearing these doubts. I love how people-centric that approach is, as it shows how dedicated Vickie and Larissa are. To prove this, they even have giveaways for vegetarian-related stuff to their followers, which really shows again how much passion they have for their organization and for the people who support them.


This podcast was interesting because of the versatility and variety of its episodes. Some episodes focused on lessons learned, others were on tips and advice, and other episodes were a perfect blend - inserting tips and experiences, making it really well-rounded. I love that I got the opportunity to not only learn more facts about vegetarianism through this podcast, but also to learn of others' experiences and how they handled their journey and what they did similarly and differently! They provided some great tips - I will definitely be trying their ginger recipes, advice for cooking tofu, and juicing recipes sometime in the near future!
